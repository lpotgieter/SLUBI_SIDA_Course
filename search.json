We will showcase the use of environments, containers, and established pipelines so that you can run these analyses on any operating system, as well as on systems that are not high performance computing clusters.\nThe website will remain active after the course so that you have access to the material, and we encourage you to share these resources with your students and other researchers that might benefit from this!\n\nProgram\n\n\nDay\nSession\n\n\n\n\nMonday\nIntroduction to nf-core and Nextflow\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Linux\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Environments\n\n\nTuesday\nIntroduction to Containers\n\n\n\nSetting up and running a Nextflow Pipeline (with us)\n\n\n\nSetting up and running a Nextflow Pipeline (by yourself)\n\n\nWednesday\nData Management and Reproducible Research\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Markdown and Quarto\n\n\n\nGitHub\n\n\n\nHow do Nextflow Pipelines Work?\n\n\nThursday\nNextflow Results\n\n\n\nUsing Containers Outside of Nextflow\n\n\n\nUsing R and Other Languages in Quarto\n\n\nFriday\nWhat are your needs? How can you implement this in your own institutions?\n\n\n\nFriday is an emptier day in case we run out of time for something, or if there is something that you would like to learn more about.\nEvery day will end with a feedback session, and we hope that you will tell us what you like, what isn’t working for you, and what you would like to see more of.",
